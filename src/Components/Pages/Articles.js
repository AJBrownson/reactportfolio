      <Word>No Role Modelz by JCole is as hot as lava in a volcano. The rapper is just tryna bring to light the moral 
        depravation of ladies nowadays. He cites examples of American actress Nia Long and even Nigerian-born
        British singer Sade Adu and how their type has become rare. According to him, the girls of nowadays are
        just shallow-minded but their coochies are deep as hell. This song contains mild swear and vulgar words. Suited for 18 years and above. Enjoy!
